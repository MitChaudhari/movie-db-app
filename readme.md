## Project Description

This project is a simple movie database application developed as part of ITMD 442's Lab 4 assignment. It utilizes MongoDB Atlas for data storage, ensuring a cloud-based, scalable solution for managing movie records. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on movie records. It's built with Node.js and Express, leveraging Pug templates for the front end, along with Bootstrap for styling, to ensure a clean and responsive user interface. Special attention was paid to sanitizing user input to enhance security and prevent injection attacks.

## Development Environment

The development environment for this project includes:

- **Computer OS**: MacBook Air M1
- **Node.js Version**: v20.11.0
- **NPM Version**: 10.5.0
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code
- Additional tools and technologies include MongoDB Atlas for the database, Express.js for the server-side logic, Bootstrap for front-end styling, and Google Docs for tasks breakdown.

## Insights and Results

Throughout the development of this lab assignment, I gained valuable experience in working with MongoDB Atlas, managing cloud-based databases, and implementing CRUD operations in a Node.js application. Challenges included ensuring data security through proper sanitization of user input and overcoming initial hurdles with setting up MongoDB Atlas. The integration of Bootstrap significantly streamlined the styling process, enhancing the application's overall look and feel.
